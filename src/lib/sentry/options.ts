 * QUOTA. The free Developer plan allows 5,000 events per month across the whole
 * organisation — and four projects share it (this app, the admin dashboard, and
 * both APIs). One noisy recurring error can consume the entire month in a day,
 * after which Sentry stops accepting events and you are blind again without being
 * told. So the filtering below is deliberately aggressive: anything that is not a
 * bug in our code is dropped before it is sent, not after.
 *
 * PII. This product handles national ID numbers, KYC document links and JWTs.
 * Sending any of that to a third party is an NDPA problem, not just an
 * embarrassment. `sendDefaultPii` stays false, and `beforeSend` strips the places
 * secrets actually turn up in practice — headers, query strings, and the local
 * variables captured in a stack frame.
